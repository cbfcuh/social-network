# Social-Network API

## Description
This Social Network platform allows the users to make API calls that allow them to share their thoughts, react to friend's thoughts and add/delete friends also. By utilising Express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose ODM it allows us to make a range of calls such as GET, PUT, POST and DELETE routes. In this project, I was able to further familiarise myself with the mentioned technologies and better understand manipulating data.
